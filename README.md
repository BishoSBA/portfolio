## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS

* Used SASS, a CSS pre-compiler to utilize better nesting for css properties and ease in usage of variables which allows ease in changing the color/theme of the website in the future
* Used JaveScript to listen to when the elements are on screen to toggle their CSS animations

## Optimizations

* Add complete information on my projects
* Add unique animations on the section links such as projects and contact sections

## Lessons Learned:

* Deploy websites on netlify and use SSL certificates
* Implement animations on scroll
* SASS familiarity

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
