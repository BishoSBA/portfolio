## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS

<<<<<<< HEAD
-   Used SASS, a CSS pre-compiler to utilize better nesting for css properties and ease in usage of variables which allows ease in changing the color/theme of the website in the future
-   Used JaveScript to listen to when the elements are on screen to toggle their CSS animations

## Optimizations

-   Add complete information on my projects
-   Add unique animations on the section links such as projects and contact sections

## Lessons Learned:

-   Deploy websites on netlify and use SSL certificates
-   Implement animations on scroll
-   SASS familiarity
